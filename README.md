# COVID-DETECTION


## Pre-requisites
- Data Preprocessing
- Visualisation
- Neural Network
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Model Training

## Advantages of detection of COVID from X-RAYS
- Blood tests are costly
- Blood tests take time ~ 5 hours
- Extent of spread can be detected


A Deep Learning Model that could detect whether a person has COVID or not, using the images of X-RAYS.
Got 97% accuracy on available datasets(validation data). Various sample images were fed to the model and it extracted the best distinctive features out of them which eventually led to it being able to identify new images
